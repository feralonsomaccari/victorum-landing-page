# Victorum Landing Page

This is a Landing Page for a parody/fake System designed to humorously manage an Empire. Controlling an Empire is no easy task, but this landing page is crafted with a mobile-first approach, using pure CSS and no frameworks.

### Why?
I created this landing page as a practice project to enhance my web development skills. By building it without using any frameworks, I focused on honing the following aspects of web development:

- CSS
- HTML
- Mobile first approach
- Responsive design
- SEO
- BEM Naming convention
